# Mini Twitter Clone using T3 Stack (Next.js, tRPC, TypeScript, Tailwind, Prisma) - Chirp

## Why was this created

I wanted to learn how the T3 stack works, mainly to learn about TypeScript & tRPC. The project was created by following a tutorial on the T3 stack by Theo.

The deployed version can be found at: https://t3-stack-chirp-overdrive141.vercel.app/
